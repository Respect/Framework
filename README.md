Oh, hello!

Just to make things clear: we don't want to build a full-stack framework.

Some people played with it, though:

  * https://github.com/mrpoundsign/Reverence
  * https://github.com/augustohp/Eight
  * https://github.com/alganet/Resplendor
  * https://gist.github.com/2256112
  * https://github.com/alganet/ConfigDoctrineSymfony2HttpKernel/

We do not endorse any of these as full stack frameworks, but they're nice to see how components can bound together.

We encourage you to try new things. Keep your interfaces clean and your code small, rock on!
